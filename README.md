# js_multiarea_cropper

js_multiarea_cropper is a frontend framework to select multiple areas of an image in a HTML page. This is currently a **WIP** project, built to be integrated with another personal project of mine.

js_multiarea_cropper is inspired by [jquery-select-areas](https://github.com/360Learning/jquery-select-areas), which is a discontinued project. It is written in vanilla JavaScript and designed to be mobile friendly (there are still work to be done in order to fully achieve this). You can try out the incomplete framework in [the demo](https://polygonalr.github.io/js_multiarea_cropper/demo/).

## Features that are being worked on
* Deletion of selection areas
* Auto-detection of the size of the image
* Resizing itself to fit the screen (especially for mobile browsers).
* Removing the reliance on global variables and functions
